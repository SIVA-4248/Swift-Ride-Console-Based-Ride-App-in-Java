# Swift-Ride-Console-Based-Ride-App-in-Java
RapiSim is a Java-based console application that simulates a simplified version of the Rapido ride-booking platform. This mini project demonstrates how core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts can be used to design a real-world system like an app for booking two-wheeler rides.

# 🚀 swift-ride -> Rapido Ride Booking Simulator in Java

RapiSim is a **console-based ride booking application** developed in Java. It simulates the functionality of real-world platforms like **Rapido** by allowing users to book rides, make payments, give feedback, and view profile details using core Java OOP concepts.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a **Java mini project** named **RapiSim**, which allows a user to:
- Log in with name, age, and phone number.
- Simulate OTP verification.
- Book a ride by entering source and destination.
- Get an estimated fare based on distance (₹10/km).
- Simulate a payment process.
- Give star-based ride feedback.
- View ride history and user profile.

It is designed using Java’s **object-oriented principles**, making it ideal for students and beginners learning Java development.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

UserProfile.java  → Abstract class with common user attributes  
AppHome.java      → Interface with ride operations  
Booking.java      → Implements AppHome, extends UserProfile  
Rapido.java       → Main class for user interaction and flow
